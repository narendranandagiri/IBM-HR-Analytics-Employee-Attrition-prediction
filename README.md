# IBM-HR-Analytics-Employee-Attrition-prediction
Data analytics and Prediction model for IBM HR data

Employee attrition is an expensive business problem and filling vacant positions costs significant time and money. Effective recruitment includes hiring, onboarding, and training – all of which translate to increased time cost and financial investment. Replacing a full-time employee can cost anywhere between half to twice the employee’s annual salary.

## :hash:**Things to do**:grey_question:
***The job is to understand the factors on which the attrition of an employee depends and making a model to predict  attrition of their valuable employees.***

**The solution is divided into the 4 sections:**
  - Data understanding and cleaning.
  - Data exploration through visualisation.
  - Feature Engineering and Modelling.
  - Model deployment.
